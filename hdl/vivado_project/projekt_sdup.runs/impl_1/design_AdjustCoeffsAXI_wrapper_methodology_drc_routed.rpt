2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.185 ns between design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/rst_ps7_0_100M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/aw.aw_pipe/aresetn_d_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.193 ns between design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/rst_ps7_0_100M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/SI_REG/ar.ar_pipe/aresetn_d_reg[1]_inv/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.197 ns between design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/rst_ps7_0_100M/U0/ACTIVE_LOW_PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_N/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/areset_d1_reg/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_AdjustCoeffsAXI_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
